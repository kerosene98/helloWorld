# helloWorld
## My Personal Evolution to the RUST language from Java*

It all starts with a Hello World app. If you are reading this then you are most probably looking for some proven evidence of my past and current projects. 

My current projects are working in **RUST-LANG** for an autonomous robotics platform based around a **Raspberry Pi** core. More as time goes on will be published on my GitHub publically.

If you would like to request a code sample, I can send you something which might meet your needs for demonstration purposes. For the time being, I am dedicating my efforts and time to **RUST-LANG**.
